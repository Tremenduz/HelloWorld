This is my first time using GitHub, also completely new to using any version-control system. This is a tutorial repository for myself, just to try and work out what all these different things are and what they do.

I am a uni student doing a course in computing and games development, although at this time I have near to no experience with coding. Hopefully I can pick up the language of C# quick... :S
